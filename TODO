-make sessions persistent across relaunches
-make sure user of api is authenticated
-redirect guest users to login page?
-get rid of TODOs in code
-hash the password on the client side before sending it
  --this obviously doesn't really provide security, but it at least shields
    the plain text of the password, in case the user uses the same password
    for other services. this is just for development, as eventually, https
    will be needed.
-do all the ui stuff
  --make it look nice
-add comments
-add votes
-add groups
-add private groups
  --authenticated users can join the group using the password. guest users
    can view the group page using the password.
-combine all of the different views into a single group page
  --each group page should be like a single page app
-create admin page for groups
  --so there's an admin array in the group and creator is auto added to it
  --power to:
    ---boot users
    ---delete events?
    ---add/demote other admins (only creator, other admins can't do this)
-build out rest of site
  --landing page
  --registration page
  --group creation page
